      <br>
      <strong>Directions</strong>
      <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
              <br>
           <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring 
               to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender 
               yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
               <br> 
            <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over 
                medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 
                about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in 
                the hot skillet, sprinkle with lemon-pepper, and brown on all 
                sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in 
                a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Combine 1/2 of the crumbled bacon, sour cream, soup, milk, and ranch 
                dressing mix in a bowl and mix until blended. Pour over chicken, add 
                drained egg noodles, and stir. Sprinkle remaining bacon on top, cover 
                with Colby-Jack cheese, and top with green onions.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and chicken is no 
                longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.</li>  
      </ol>
