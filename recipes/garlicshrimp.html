      <ul>

          <li>1/3 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <strong>Directions</strong>
      <ol>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it 
              just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of 
              the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
              <br>
           <li>Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp begin to 
               turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
               <br> 
            <li>Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir 1 
                minute.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 piece butter, and 1/2 of 
                the parsley. Cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in remaining 3 pieces butter. Cook 
                and stir until butter has melted, sauce is thick, and shrimp are pink 
                and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; 
                continue to cook butter sauce, adding water 1 teaspoon at a time if 
                too thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Serve shrimp topped with the pan sauce and remaining parsley.</li>
